Changes icon to a new icon!
Value 1: Which character (dad or bf), icon name.
Value 2: "hex" or "rgb" code for health bar color.

Also for "Icon name" you can surround with " to just
get it from characters instead by putting their lua tag!
Example -
    Value 1: bf, gf
    Value 2: rgb, 165,0,77 (if via tag, v2 does nothing)
